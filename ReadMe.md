## Unit 2 - Skateboard

## Description

Today we are designing a skateboard, and all it's various parts. The deck is simple to make, just a sketch extruded. The truck (baseplate, hanger, bushing) is more advanced, as there are multiple surfaces and parts you have to work with. But, if you take it slow and simple, making sure nothing remains undefined, it falls into place as not much more than an exercise in CAD. The new, difficult part (for most people) is the split and move face. My advice for that is copying a sketch to both sides of an object can help in making that split (and thus move face) work easier.

Advice is numbered by which step of the tutorial they best align with.

2.1. Constraints are stronger than dimensions. Even if you wanted to go through the effort of doing all the math, it would break as soon as you need to change one dimension.

2.2. When doing Multi-Part Modeling, using different perspectives is essential. You can adjust the angle a tiny bit, or even switch the whole part to being translucent.

2.4. Replicate is a very useful tool! So useful, in fact, that [my teacher](https://github.com/Helmstk1) says one would be lying to say Replicate isn't helpful. It just keeps away the menial task of making sure every single mate connector is put on right.

2.5. Use the Use tool! It's so helpful for making sure everything stays connected, but in a non-convoluted way. It lets you use anything from a single point, to a whole sketch. It's how I made the very odd shape of the deck.

2.5. **No. Blue. Unless. You. Spline.** Like, actually. I've been bluer than Eeyore with my sketches before, but it just ends in the whole 6-week project falling apart because one dimension couldn't scale.

Frankly, this whole process was never frustrating, it was just an exercise in patience and 'sustainable' CAD. The shorcuts aren't shorcuts if them failing breaks way too much. It's like a [switchback](https://trailandsummit.com/what-is-a-switchback-in-hiking/). Yes, it may be quicker to go up a mountain in a straight line, but it makes it harder to go down, and harder to even go up if you ever have to traverse that path again.

3.1. This point has been highlighted before, but I think it should be re-stated; The value of relations and design intent. Specifically, how they interact with eachother. Obviously, you have to make these relationships between the pieces, so everything can be assembled together. But, it's about the purpose with every step. Frankly, the skateboard designed above didn't have this purpose put into it. Some dimensions were made just to turn a blue line black, not with any actual function in mind. It doesn't need to be have some vast, abstract meaning, but it needs a meaning nonetheless.

3.2. Frankly, the most helpful thing is following this tutorial. Using configurations can be amazing, but that's the entire point of 3.2.

3.3. This is also a pretty simple one, but in going through the tutorial, a big mistake was made in about half of the snaps. The bricks were snapped to the wrong line, and the duck looked more, well, homely.

3.4.

3.5.
